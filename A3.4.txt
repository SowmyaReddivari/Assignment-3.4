1. Explain HDFS federation and High availability
   
   HDFS Federation:
 
         - HDFS Federation improves the hdfs architecture by using namespace and storage

         - It supports multiple namespaces in the cluster to improve the scalabilty and isolation.

         - It extends the HDFS cluster to new implementations and use cases.

         - Federation uses independent namenodes to scale the name service horizontally.

         - For example,Face book faces some limitations.These limitations are solved by HDFS Federation.

         - In HDFS Federation,Block Pool is used.It is a set of block from a single namespace.

         - It supports scalability and isolation.
  
   High availability:

         - Hadoop 2.0 introduce High availability as new feature.

         - Hadoop 2.o supports multiple name nodes.

         - It Provides vendor to be available at all the time by deploying two NameNode.

         - It supports automated failover by using stack resiliency and a standby node.

         - These High availability are used for handling NameNode failure without any loss of data.

         - It self recovers from failures.

          
2. How HDFS handles failures while writing data
     
         - HDFS uses Pipeline method for writing data into a file.
        
         - HDFS uses namenodes to store the multiple replicas of a block.

         - HDFS is Fault tolerant.So if a datanode fails while writing the data then we can recover all the data and files.
         
         - In PipeLine recovery,if any failure occurs the pipeline is closed and remaining packets in the queue are added to data queue so that we will not miss any packets.
  
         - The failed node is removed and new datanodes are used for remaining blocks.
         
         - When multiple nodes leads to the failure then by using replication techniques we can retrieve our data easily.
         
         - There are many other data recovery techniques like data streamimg Failure recovery and close Fail recovery.
